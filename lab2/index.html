<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<p1>Hey! I'm Sean and I'm working alone on this lab (again) because I entered yet another class late. I enjoy doing everything and ALMOST anything (which is why I changed my major five times). I spend most of my freetime eating, doing homework, thinking about doing homework, playing video games, sleeping, being obsessed with Nicki Minaj, and a wide variety of other things. I'd consider myself a very spontaneous individual.</p>
