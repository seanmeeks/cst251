			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of Lab 8 is to show our understanding of what we learned about CSS through styling our Lab 8 webpage using different types of CSS selectors. We were instructed to create an index.html file for Lab 8 and upload an image. We are then to create CSS file link the lab8/index.css to our lab8/index.html. After doing so we are to test our files locally to see if everything works the way it should and then upload them to the server. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> The only issue that I had when completing this lab is making the background of the white background sections less opaque. Usually when I add colors to the CSS, I utilize the HEX color. What I found out was that I needed to use the RGB color instead so I can add the opacity setting. </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> The results of this lab is this page as it incorporates styling through CSS. The image of Nicki Minaj above enlarges when the mouse is hovered over it. Enjoy!</p>
