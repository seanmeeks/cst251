			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of Lab 13 is to build on our understanding of what we learned about CSS previously through recreating an interesting webpage design found from typography articles. After doing so we are to test our files locally to see if everything works the way it should and then upload them to the server.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> When completing Lab 13, the only issue I had was getting to put an image within the text so the text-fill "color" could be an image. I couldn't get this to work so I took to photoshop to do so and then entered the image instead. Other than that, I had no issues.</p>
