	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p> The goal of this lab is to add links to our website. These links either link to other websites or back to our landing page. One of the images that we added would need to link to one of the website's we created as well. Atfer testing our files locally (on our computers through Atom) to see if everything works, we then were to push our changes to the origin and HTML be accessable on the server (Github). </p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I ultimately had very few issues when completing this lab. I've added links on my homepage previously so that was an easy step. Altough the links that I previously added on my homepage just linked to other files in the HTML, being able to take what ui had learned and applying that to linking website URLs from my page was pretty simple. The only issue that I ran into was making my hyperlink back to my homepage's text smaller. I could not figure out how to do that, so it's the same size as the other hyperlinks. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The result of Lab 5 are shown below. The screenshots are images of my favorite websites and when clicked, the images take you to the same website domain as the hyperlinks below them. </p>
