			<br>Yo, ayo, tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted</br>
			<br>Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it</br>

			<br>Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted</br>
			<br>This what you came, this what you came for</br>
			<br>You get what you buy, this what you paid for</br>
			<br>So make sure the stars is what you aim for</br>
			<br>Make mistakes though</br>
			<br>I never worry, life is a journey</br>
			<br>I just wanna enjoy the ride</br>
			<br>What is the hurry? It's pretty early</br>
			<br>It's okay, we'll take our time</br>

			<br>Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way</br>
			<br>Maybe that is why I chase strangers away</br>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of Lab 12 is to build on our understanding of what we learned about CSS previously through styling our Lab 11 webpage using more rules of CSS that we learned.  We were to add "Challenge," "Problems," and "Results" sections along with the corresponding information about our experiences with the lab. We were then to style the various texts using different methods of block-level styling such as text and image alignment. We were to utilize various elements utilized to either center our image/sample texts as vertically, horizontally, or <i>floated</i> to a certain side. As a bonus, we were to add a large image to a div and make the div smaller than the image, but make it so that the image  is centered vertically and horizontally so you see only the middle part of the image. After doing so we are to test our files locally to see if everything works the way it should and then upload them to the server.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> When completing Lab 12, I had almost no issues. I have used the float tool in previous Labs (which I now know is the reason why I had certain errors in the past). The only issue that I did have was when centering a couple of the divs and the images. When I centered the divs, I did not realize that I had to also center the image inside the div so when I went to center the div, I was confused as to why the image was not centered as well. I had to go back and center the image inside the div so that it was actually centered correctly on the page.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> The results of this lab are shown on this page as it uses styling through CSS and the use of different text and image alignments to set the images in the center and the texts on the sides (and everything else, too).</p>
