	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p> The purpose of this lab is to complete a file transfer by changing and testing our local files and eventually uploading them to the server. The local files are our HTML source codes saved on Atom on our own computers. Once the HTML source code is pushed to the origin and appears on our Github websites, it becomes part of the server.   </p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I ultimately had no issues when completing this lab. For the past few labs, I have been making changes to my HTML source code, commiting those changes to the master and them pushing them to the origin, so this lab was a piece of cake. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The result of Lab 4 is this very page that you're currently viewing. This page (and ultimately the entire website) is the product of transfering local files to a server. Screenshots of the process are included below. The images you see below are prior to the addition of the images into the HTML source code and the webpage because I couldn't take screenshots of the completed lab and HTML source code, which includes screenshots of the HTML source code in Atom and as it appears in the browser, when the screenshots that I needed to take and add to the cst251/lab4/img folder are supposed to include the HTML source code and the HTML as it appears in Chrome. That's impossible because I can't take a screenshot of the <i>completed</i> website and the HTML source code if the webpages tecnically aren't completed without the screenshot that I'm currently taking. So I just took screenshots of the HTML source code, the HTML as it appears in Chrome, and the changes I made on Github desktop and pushed those changes to the origin <i>all without</i> the images and added them after. </p>
