			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this lab is to create an index.html file for Lab 7 and upload an image. We are then to create CSS file and style our website and Lab 7 page and link the lab7/index.css to our lab7/index.html. After doing so we are to test our files locally to see if everything works the way it should and then upload them to the server. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> I did not run into any problems in this Lab as I had previously created and utilized CSS on literally all of the lab assignments prior to this one and have uploaded images as well, so this lab was pretty easy. </p>

		<div class="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
