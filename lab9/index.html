			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of Lab 9 is to build on our understanding of what we learned about CSS previously through styling our Lab 9 webpage using more rules that we learned. We should have uploaded an image to our page and styled it,  modifed the margins and padding of our content div, added a border, and changed the color of our body and content div. As a bonus, we were to go back and style our homepage and create a sitewide CSS file that could be utilized to style new pages. After doing so we are to test our files locally to see if everything works the way it should and then upload them to the server. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> I did not have any problems when completing Lab 9 as I have perviously utilized these CSS styling rules on all of my previous Labs. I even styled my homepage and added a basic CSS stylesheet in my cst251/css file earlier on.
