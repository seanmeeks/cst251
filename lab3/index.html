		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> The purpose of this lab was to create a local file structure. We were instructed to create lab folders nested in the CST251 folder that is synced to Atom. After doing so, we were to create css and image folders within lab folders 2-6 which would hold our screenshots and website's style coding. We were also to edit out landing page to include an image and paragraph about oursleves and indlude links to pages for the labs 2-6. In the end, we would have an updated lab 3 page, landing page, and a clear file structure.
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> During this process I ran into various problems. At first, I had trouble adding my image to the site. When I tried to link the imagine on the HTML and show it on the web browser, the image would not appear. Turns out that thet problem was that I didn't correctly source the file. ALso, when I was chanign the font, background color and other stylish things in the HTML, the effects would take place on both the landing page and the lab 3 page, which is what I did not want to occur. I figured out that the issue was that I was putting the coding in the site.css file instead of the lab 3 file. The site.css edits the entire site. So, I had to make the changes in the lab 3 css file if I wanted the changes to only appear on the Lab 3 page. All in all, even though I ran into some complications, I completed the lab.
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> The results of this lab are shown in the images below: The new file structure and the HTML source code and the landing page as it appears in the browser. </p>
