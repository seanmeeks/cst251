			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of Lab 10 is to build on our understanding of what we learned about CSS previously through styling our Lab 10 webpage using more CSS rules that we learned. We were to add "Challenge," "Problems," and "Results" sections along with the corresponding information about our experiences with the lab. We were then to style the various texts using new fonts, colors, text-transform, and letter-spacing. As a bonus, we were to choose a Google font for our headings and also go back and style our homepage with our new knowledge about using fonts in CSS. After doing so we are to test our files locally to see if everything works the way it should and then upload them to the server. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> Most of this lab was pretty easy. I utilized different fonts and text styles in previous. The only issue that I had was incorporating a Google font. Whenever I added and saved a Google font to my CSS file, it would not appear on my website. Instead, the font would default to the font style I have set in sitewide CSS file. I have yet to figure this issue out, but I did utilize a different font (Harrington) for my headings than the one that I normally use (Bell MT). </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> The various results of this lab are shown throughout this page as it incorporates styling through CSS and the modification/utilization of new fonts, different colors, text-transforms, and letter-spacing.</p>
