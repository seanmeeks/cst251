			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of Lab 16 was to build on our understanding of what we learned about CSS previously through styling our Lab 16 webpage using more rules of CSS that we learned. We were to style the Lab 16 webpage using different methods of "fancy" CSS styling such as different backgrounds as well as transition, animation, and column elements. As a bonus, we were to add some of these effects to our homepage and create two other web pages that use these effects (both "tacky" and "classy"). After doing so we are to test our files locally to see if everything works the way it should and then upload them to the server.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Although I have never used any of these elements before this lab, when completing Lab 16, I had no issues. With the help of W3schools, I was able to <i>quickly</i> get the hang of these elements to create different effects.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> The results of this lab are shown on this page as it uses the <i>fancy</i> styling by CSS through the use of the aforementioned elements to create the effects.</p>
