			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of Lab 15 was to build on our understanding of what we learned about CSS previously through styling our Lab 15 webpage using more rules of CSS that we learned. We were to style page using different methods of "fancy" CSS styling such as text-shadow, box-shadow, gradient, filters, rounded corners, object-fit, and transform elements. As a bonus, we were to add some of these effects to our homepage and create two other web pages that use these effects (both "tacky" and "classy"). After doing so we are to test our files locally to see if everything works the way it should and then upload them to the server.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> When completing Lab 15, I had no issues. I have used the text-shadow, box-shadow, gradient, border-radius (which rounds the edges), and transform elements in previous labs; getting the hang of the filer and object-fit elements was very easy.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> The results of this lab are shown on this page as it uses the <i>fancy</i> styling by CSS through the use of the aforementioned elements to create the effects. </p>
