			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of Lab 14 is to build on our understanding of what we learned about CSS previously through recreating an interesting webpage design found from typography articles. After doing so we are to test our files locally to see if everything works the way it should and then upload them to the server.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> When completing Lab 14, I didn't have any issues. Since we had the same assignment as the previous lab (with a different webpage to design), completing this one was not difficult.</p>
