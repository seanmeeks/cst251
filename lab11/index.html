			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The purpose of Lab 11 is to build on our understanding of what we learned about CSS previously through styling our Lab 11 webpage using more rules that we learned.  We were to add "Challenge," "Problems," and "Results" sections along with the corresponding information about our experiences with the lab. We were then to style the various texts using different methods of block-styling (more specifically inline-block styling) and style our navigation links so that they stick to the top of the page when one scrolls down. As a bonus, we were to go back to our homepage and add a sticky menu or a sidebar to link to our labs and use relative, fixed, or absolute elements. After doing so we are to test our files locally to see if everything works the way it should and then upload them to the server.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> When completing Lab 11, I did have one primary complication. The main complication that I had was having the link stick to the top of the page using the "sticky" position. I could not figure out how to get the link to stick to the top of the page after the viewer scrolls to a certain point of the page. So instead of doing that, I utilized the "fixed" position instead so that it's still in view in the same point on the page even when the viewer scrolls, but not stuck to the top of the page. Other than that, Lab 11 went smoothly as I quickly learned how to add and style a sidebar into my Lab 11 page and to my homepage. </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> The results of this lab are shown on this page as it incorporates styling through CSS and the use of an aside to form a sidebar filled with information. </p>
